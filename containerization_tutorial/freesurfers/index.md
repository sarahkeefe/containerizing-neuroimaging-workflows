# FreeSurfers directory

This directory is intended to store OASIS3 FreeSurfer data. Once you have access to the [OASIS-3 dataset], use the [OASIS download scripts] to download example FreeSurfer data from XNAT Central using the included `containerization_tutorial_fs_to_download.csv` input file. 

Download instructions for OASIS-3 FreeSurfer files can be found in the [oasis-scripts Github repository readme file].

Once the download is complete, move the downloaded FreeSurfer subject folder `OAS30001_MR_d3132` into your copy of this directory.
