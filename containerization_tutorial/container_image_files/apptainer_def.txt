	# freesurfer/freesurfer:7.3.2 uses CentOS 8
	# Install programs using a CentOS 8 package manager
	# First clean and update the package repository - just like we would do on a totally new OS installation
	yum clean all && yum -y update 

	# Then install some dependencies I will need for the next program download and installation steps
	# The FSL installer script requires python3
	# FSL fslreorient2std requires "bc"
	# FSL flirt requires openblas
	yum -y install epel-release bc git openblas python3 tar unzip wget

	# Run the "fs_install_mcr" script to install the Freesurfer MATLAB compiler runtime
	# This step wasn't done by default in the base container.
	/usr/local/freesurfer/bin/fs_install_mcr R2014b

	# Download FSL installer Python script
	wget -q http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsldownloads/fslinstaller.py && chmod 775 fslinstaller.py

	# Run the FSL installer python script
	# We are installing FSL to /usr/local/fsl within the container
	python3 fslinstaller.py -d /usr/local/fsl --fslversion 6.0.6.5

	# Run the FSL config setup script
	/bin/bash -c 'source /usr/local/fsl/etc/fslconf/fsl.sh'
