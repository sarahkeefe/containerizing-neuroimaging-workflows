Once you have a container image that can successfully take in data and run your custom workflow script, you can put it into action.

[Batch running containers] will look at the example "batch scripts" provided that will let you run a bunch of instances of your container image at once on a bigger dataset.

[Sharing container images] will go over ways to export and share your container image so you can share it with other collaborators or on public image repositories.
