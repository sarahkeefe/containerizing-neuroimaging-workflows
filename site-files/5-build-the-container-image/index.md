# Build the container image

Once you have all the steps written out in your container definition file, it is time to try building the container image. This process will likely involve some waiting, error troubleshooting, fixing, and re-building, so be patient!

[Build a Docker image] will go over the build steps needed if you have set up an image definition file in Dockerfile format.

[Build an Apptainer image] will go over the build steps needed if you have set up an image definition file in Apptainer/Singularity format.

[Troubleshooting and rebuilding] will provide some tips on investigating errors and rerunning build commands.
